# Maternal_Health_Risk_Prediction
Predicting pregnancy risk using classification models
This is my first ever machine learning project. It explores the possibility of predicting pregnancy-related risk levels using health data. Among the tested classification algorithms, Random Forest performed the best.

The project was developed as part of a university course assignment. It was divided into two stages: an exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase and a classification phase. Certain steps were required for the assignment to be approved, and some of them may appear loosely connected. I have attempted made adjustments to improve the flow and increase the relevance of the analysis for the classification task. Due to its nature as a school project, each step is thoroughly explained to support understanding and transparency.

I approached this project as a complete beginner in machine learning, with only basic knowledge of Python. As a result, the project lacks more advanced components such as pipelines, grid search tuning, or model explainability methods (e.g., SHAP). These are topics I hope to explore in future projects, once I gain more experience.

Despite its limitations, this project reflects my first attempt to apply ML techniques to real-world data and to learn through hands-on practice.
